# Hello World Sample

This is a sample of a good `README.md` file that can be used when describing a project.  
You can change the headings to fit your needs, but the idea is to provide:  

- **A summary of the project**  
- **The files used**  
- **Programs written**  
- **How to execute the program**  

Think of this as **documentation**.
